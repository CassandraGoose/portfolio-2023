    PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS

  <p slot="card-context" class="m-4" data-cy="project-title">
    I have had the opportunity to work on several production applications in my
    career. I have worked for product companies and also worked for a
    consultancy, where I worked on various teams and with various technologies.

      title="Physical Location Personel Management System Dashboard"
      tech="TypeScript, React, MUI, Vite, Axios, Zod, Sentry, React Testing Library, Playwright"
    >
      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        I delivered the bulk of the functionality as the only front end
        developer on the team, which was tasked with creating a dashboard for
        users to explore logs and edit personel. While the functionality was
        largely CRUD-based, I had to make decisions to not only ensure the
        longevity of the code but also deliver on-pace with expected deadlines,
        which were extremely tight. I balanced delivering quick features with
        testing, performance, security, and error tracking.

      title="Insurance Mental Health Provider Finder"

    >
      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        I worked on a team of 2 developers, one product manager, and mental
        health staff from the client company to create a wizard style
        application to quickly allow users to access mental health assistance,
        particularly during crisis events. This full-stack application allowed
        for users to directly communicate with potential providers, book
        appointments, and find care. This project was HIPAA compliant.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        As one of two developers, I was challenged with delivering much of the
        functionality which involved interfacing with the client company APIs
        and SMTP. I utilized JSS to style the application according to the
        client company's design specs. I often paired with the other developer
        on particularly challenging sections of the application and we reviewed
        each other's code. I continually delivered my stories fully tested and
        cleaned on time for each sprint. I also got the opportunity to not only
        present my work to the clients every sprint, but also brainstorm with
        the clients to uncover the features their users needed.

      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        I acted as a tech lead for a team of 4 developers, one product manager,
        and the client company to create a wizard style career finder which
        utilized a psychology-based algorithm to match users to a set of
        careers. This application also contained a tracker for high school
        students to prepare for college.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        I was tasked with reviewing code from the other 3 developers, acting as
        architect, completing features, and mentoring the other developers. I
        continually identified and fixed issues and worked to future-proof the
        application. I implemented continuous integration and deployment for
        this project, as well. I inherited this application in its early life
        and identified some security issues and also noted that the API was not
        RESTful. After creating a refactor proposal and presenting it to
        stakeholders, the team spent 2 sprints fixing the vulnerabilities and
        set the application up so that future work would be much more seamless
        and fast.

      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        I worked on the R&D team with 3 other developers and a project manager
        to construct a graphical application to allow law enforcement officers
        and prosecution teams to create visual aids based on investigation and
        case data.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2 text-lg">
        We worked closely with a group of users to design helpful tooling and
        address unexpected issues. We pushed the boundaries of browser
        capabilities to render large amounts of data in helpful ways and perform
        calculations in a serverless situation.

        This tool consumed the client's API in order to display data regarding
